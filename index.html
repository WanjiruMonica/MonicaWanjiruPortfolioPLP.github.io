                <h3>WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS IN L.VICTORIA</h3>
                <p>Ideally, in a balanced ecosystem, water hyacinth should be kept in check by natural predators. However, on Lake Victoria, the growth and spread of the weed has persisted despite the governmentâ€™s various biological interventions such as introducing water hyacinth weevils. The control and management interventions have not been fully successful as the aquatic weed is adaptive to the methods used to control it. The growth and spread brings to a halt, economic activities on the lake such as fishing and tourism as the weed blocks transportation by boats.<br />
                    It is therefore important to understand the ecological conditions in which water hyacinth thrives in order to mitigate its emergence and prevalence. Through monitoring water quality parameters, specifically water temperature, water salinity and water pH, the growth and spread patterns of the weed in relation to these parameters could be established.<br />
                    This would be the first step in identifying physical and chemical methods that target water temperature, ph and salinity to prevent the growth and spread of water hyacinth. .</p>

                <h3>MAIZE TRENDS ANALYSIS IN KENYA</h3>
                <p>Maize is a staple food in Kenya and its production is crucial for food security. This project aims to analyze maize production trends in Kenya using historical data to identify patterns, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. The analysis will focus on factors such as yield, acreage, and climatic conditions affecting maize production.</p>
